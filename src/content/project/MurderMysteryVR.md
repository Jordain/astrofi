## Project Details

I spent two weeks creating a VR game with my friends for Facebook's XR Hackathon 2021. We focused on facebook's audio SDK to use our voice to speak with the characters. I primarily focused on the interactions with items and creating all the 3d assets, audio and video editing. 

## Challenges

Some challenges we faced:
- Hardware limitations with the oculus headset. I had to optimize all of the 3d assets so that it would run smoothly on the headset.
- This was our first VR project so we had to learn the basics of Unity within the two weeks.
- Since it was only two weeks we really had to focus on keeping the scope doable within the time frame.
- Testing and Bug Fixing: With a tight schedule.
- Learning Curve with Facebook's Audio SDK.
- Version control was tricky because we wanted to use GitHub free version, but we were hitting the rate limits so we had to break it up in peices.
